    This API provides access to scan results of the Social Coding platform compliance checker. It allows administrators of the Social Coding platform to monitor the compliance state of projects and repositories on the platform and, in case of violations that are not automatically corrected, contact the responsible administrators. The API also allows administrators of projects on the Social Coding platform to individually scan their projects for violations.

    Benefits:
    - Easily include results of compliance scans in reporting tools, such as Splunk
    - Easily integrate the compliance checker into dashboards for the Social Coding platform
    - Integrate the project scan feature into the BIOSphere portal

    Features
    - Get the list of metadata for all scans (available to all users)
    - Get metadata for the latest scan (available to all users)
    - Get metadata for individual scans (available to all users)
    - Get detailed scan results including compliance violations for individual scans (available to Social Coding platform admins)
    - Scan individual project and get scan results (available for associates with access to the project)
